- Focus on your Progress task by Filter it, and it can give you a quick view on your list.

### Extra Features

- Additional Descriptions help the user to better understand the task.

### Why you think the way you did it is good. ?

in this application, I create it using Local Storage (Async Storage). where with this we can access freely without the internet and it will provide better performance.

### what you would have done if you have infinite time ?

1. add duetime so that existing reminders can be more specific from the day to the hour.
2. make a reminder from existing dueTime (probably will use a notification but there is no description for this, still need to explore).
3. filter task by today and upcoming day so user can focus on our today and tomorrow tasks.
4. OnBoarding Page with a little description about the app can provide instructions or how to use the app
